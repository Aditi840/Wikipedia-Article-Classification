# Wikipedia-Article-Classification
Classify Wikipedia articles into categories using machine learning to improve search and recommendation systems.

#Project Description
The Wikipedia Article Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify articles whether they are featured or not.

#How to Run and Install The Project
Download the project source code from a repository or website.
Install the required dependencies or libraries.
Set up any configuration files or environment variables required by the project.
Run the project by executing the main script or command.

#Post-Analysis Questions
1. Whatâ€™s the accuracy you are getting?
Using the logistic regression model, we are getting 75% of accuracy.

2. What if you choose SVM instead of logistic regression?
Using SVM instead of logistic regression can lead to different results in terms of model performance and interpretability,  However, SVM can be more computationally expensive than logistic regression, especially for large datasets. Additionally, SVMs can be less interpretable than logistic regression.

3.What features do you think are important? Can you get the same accuracy using only a
single feature?
It is possible to get an accuracy score using a single feature. For example, using only the number of categories, we can achieve an accuracy score of around 0.63.
